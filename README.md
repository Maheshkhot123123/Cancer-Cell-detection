# Cancer-Cell-detection


## Problem Statement
Accurate cancer diagnosis is essential for effective treatment.  
This project helps identify **cancerous vs non-cancerous cells** from microscopic images using Deep Learning.

## Solution
We developed a **CNN-based deep learning model** that analyzes microscopic cell images and predicts whether a cell is cancerous, assisting medical professionals in diagnosis.

## How It Works
1. Collect and preprocess microscopic cell images  
2. Train a CNN model on labeled datasets  
3. Predict cancerous or non-cancerous cells  
4. Support doctors in faster decision-making  

## Datasets Used
- **UCSB Bio-Segmentation Dataset**
- **Kaggle Blood Cell Dataset**
- **TCGA Dataset**

## Model
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- Image-based feature extraction and classification

## Results
- **Accuracy:** ~81%  
- Reliable and robust performance on unseen test images  

## Future Scope
- Train on larger datasets for higher accuracy  
- Classify multiple cancer types  
- Deploy as a web/mobile application  
- Integrate real-time medical analysis  

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how deep learning can assist in **early cancer detection** by analyzing microscopic images, improving diagnosis speed and reliability.
